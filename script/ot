# ABSTRACT: parse text and (hopefully) open an editor with the correct arguments
# PODNAME: ot

=pod

=head1 DESCRIPTION

It can be a pain to have to copy Perl module names from a stack trace or some
other output and have to translate that into something which an editor like vim
understands.  This module aims to take some of the pain out of this.  So far I
have tested this only with vim, but I *think* this should also work with emacs
and nano.

The C<ot> script can parse line numbers from text so that you can open your
files at the correct starting point.  It will also try to translate subroutine
names into the appropriate line numbers.  It will look in a lib or t/lib
directory relative to your current path.  If it thinks it has a Perl module
name it will also try to require it and use %INC in order to find the module on
disks.  All security caveats apply when requiring 3rd party modules.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    ot "lib/Foo/Bar.pm line 222"
    # Executes $ENV{EDITOR} +222 lib/Foo/Bar.pm

    # open Foo::Bar which is in your lib, t/lib or @INC
    ot Foo::Bar

    # open Foo::Bar at the do_something() subroutine
    ot "Foo::Bar::do_something()"

    # open Foo::Bar at the do_something() subroutine
    ot "Foo::Bar::do_something('HASH(0x25521248)')"

    # open output from git-grep
    ot lib/Open/This.pm:17

    # Find a core module
    ot Test::More

    # Open a core module at a function
    ot "Test::More::diag()"

    # open Foo::Bar on the GitHub web site in your browser
    ot -b Foo::Bar

=head1 ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

By default, C<ot> will search your C<lib> and C<t/lib> directories for local files.  You can override this via the C<$ENV{OPEN_THIS_LIBS}> variable.  It accepts a comma-separated list of libs.

    export OPEN_THIS_LIBS=lib,t/lib,t/other-lib

Or

    OPEN_THIS_LIBS=lib,t/lib,t/other-lib ot Foo::Bar

Probably you want to export this variable in your C<~/.bashrc> file (or some
other appropriate place in your dot files.
